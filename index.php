<h3> THE JOURNEY</h3>
<p>
    
I set out for a journey 
It's end I know not
A journey to break the norms
A journey to break the traditions
Traditions of my forefathers 
A journey to set me free
Free from this bondage

I refuse 
Refuse to be ruled by my past
A past that has filled my path with dust
A past that has harboured pain in my heart
A past that has left a poor wretch hurt

I'm out on this journey 
A journey with a purpose 
To bring life to a living carcass 
To unfold the hidden potential 
To break the covenants of my traditions
Traditions with meaningless conditions 
My missions in this journey must be achieved 
Before they are archived

In this journey 
Despite the challenges 
Despite the indifferences 
Nothing will hinder me
Nothing will kill my spirit 
My spirit to fight
Fight for my freedom 
Until justice prevails

My success 
My job
The love of my life
My unborn kids
My future to be precise 
Is bound in my traditions
Traditions my foot!!! 

Not until I find justice 
Not until I'm set free
Not until iam unchained 
From my clueless norms and traditions 
I will keep going down the journey 
My journey for freedom 

I will fight like a warrior 
I will stand strong and firm like a rock
To unchain myself and generation at large
From the ancestral bondage 
If you can't help me fight
Then watch me in this journey

<h3> BROKEN ANGEL </h3>
<p>
    
I don't know why but when I saw you first
I didn't see your angelic strength
No I felt the despair dancing on your broken wings
The silent cracks playing in your beautiful armor

Like a bird striving to fly
You fought the dark eating you from within
You forced a smile to your face even when your soul said no
And that was your true victory

Like a broken winged bird 
You fought the storms
Tearing yourself piece by piece
Until you were no more
But no matter what they say that was your true strength 

Like a caged bird you fought in the silence of the night
Crying in pain and yet never despairing 
Fighting the dark clouds tearing you apart 
And that's your true victory 

A broken angel racing the fates forced upon 
And smiling even when the dark threatened to tear down
And like a free healing bird
Swarming the skies with cries of silent war

*a true rose that kept the thorns only for safety you were*
